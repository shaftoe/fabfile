# My [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) tasks

Those are custom scripts which I use from my [Linux|macOS] workstations, but they should be easily configurable for your own needs; feel free to use at your own risk.

## install_terraform

Install `terraform` binary in `~/bin` folder

## setup_macos

Setup macOS installing software via Pip / Homebrew / Cask / mas (Apple store). You can overwrite the default lists of software to be installed editing `fabricrc`
